      Ratan Naval Tata[a] (28 December 1937 â€“ 9 October 2024) was an Indian
      industrialist and philanthropist. He served as the chairman of Tata Group
      and Tata Sons from 1991 to 2012 and he held the position of interim
      chairman from October 2016 to February 2017.[3][4] In 2000, he received
      the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in India, followed by
      the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second highest civilian honour, in
      2008.[5] Ratan Tata was the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji
      Tata, son of Jamshedji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated
      from Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree
      in architecture.[6] He had also attended the Harvard Business School (HBS)
      Advanced Management Program in 1975.[1] He joined the Tata Group in
      1962,[7] starting on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J.
      R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991.
      During his tenure, the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and
      Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into
      a global business.
